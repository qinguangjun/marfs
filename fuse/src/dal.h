// allocate storage here for whatever state they need.

// DAL_Context).  This can be initialized (if needed) in dal_ctx_init().
// It will initially be NULL.  If desired, one could use dal_ctx_init()
// to give individual contexts a link to the global state.
//
// The MarFS calls to the DAL implementation functions will not touch the
// contents of the Context, except that we call init_dal_context() when
// MarFS file-handles are created, and delete_dal_context() when MarFS
// file-handles are destroyed.
